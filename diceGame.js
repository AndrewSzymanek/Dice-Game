//As a user, I want to climb a mountain where my success is based off the results of dice rolls.
// As a user, I want the different sections of my climb to be based off different sided dice.
// As a user, I want to have my health and stamina tracked as I climb where various events effect both.
// As a user, I want to win the game, if I make it to the summit of the mountain with health and stamina greater than zero.
// As a user, I want the ability to rest at the half way point which could restore my stamina and maybe some health.
// Bonus:
// As a user, I want to see a visual progression up a "Mountain".
